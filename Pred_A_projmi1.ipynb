    "# Project Title: Algorithmic Bias Detection in Healthcare Predictive Models\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to rigorously identify and quantify potential **algorithmic bias** within hypothetical healthcare predictive models. Drawing from experience with diverse rural communities, particularly in Alaska, I recognize the critical need to ensure that AI models deliver **fair and equitable outcomes** across all demographic groups. This initiative will investigate if model predictions systematically disadvantage certain populations, striving to foster more just and reliable healthcare AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Project Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective is to enhance fairness and reduce disparities in healthcare outcomes by **auditing a predictive model's behavior**. This involves:\n",
    "* **Detective bias:** Identifying if the model exhibits systematic bias related to protect attributes (e.g., race, socioeconomic status).\n",
    "* **Proposing mitigation strategies:** Developing actionable recommendations to address and reduce any detected bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Following a structured predictive analytics process, this project frames the challenge as a **classification-adjacent problem**. Rather than predicting a patient outcome directly, the project will \"classify\" instances of model outputs or the model's overall behaviour as 'fair' or 'biased' for specific subgroups. This approach is conceptually similar to auditing a credit risk model to ensure it doesn't disproportionately classify certain groups as high-risk without just cause. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The core problem is to **identify and quantify systematic disparities** in a predictive model's performance or outputs across different demographic subgroups, particularly those that are historically marginalized. This requires a precise definition that moves beyond a general problem statement to enable statistical modeling and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Data Collection & Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing relevant datasets is crucial. I would primarily source anonymized health data from platforms like **Kaggle Datasets** and **Data.Gov**. These datasets would ideally include **demographic features** (such as gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic indicators) alongside associated health outcomes or hypothetical model predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific data sources considered: \n",
    "* **Kaggle:** Datasets explicitly designed for **algorithmic bias analysis in healthcare** (e.g., searching for \"Bias in Medical Field\" or similar terms) or synthetic healthcare datasets adaptable for bias studies.\n",
    "* **Data.Gov:** Broader **health disparities datasets**, including those available through initiatives like **Healthy People 2030**. This resource provides valuable information on health outcomes broken down by various demographic characteristics, enabling the investigation of disparities (e.g., data on maternal mortality rates varying by racial groups, or differences in chronic disease prevalence across socioeconomic strata.) More information on these disparities and data collection can be found on the Healthy People 2030 website: [https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/about-disparities-data](https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/about-disparities-data).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Modeling/Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This phase involves applying **fairness metrics** and statistical tests to analyze how the hypothetical model's predictions (or actual outcomes) vary across different demographic groups. If a secondary model is developed to predict bias, standard classification algorithms would be employed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Success will be measured by two key ares: \n",
    "* **Quantifying disparity reduction:** Assessing the decrease in disparities across subgroups using specific fairness metrics.\n",
    "*  **Traditional performance per group:** Evaluating model performance metrics (e.g., precision, recall) calculated independently for each demographic subgroup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5 Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will culminate in: \n",
    "* A **detailed report** outlining detected bias\n",
    "*  **Visualizations** clearly illustrating the identified disparities.\n",
    "*   **Concrete recommendations** for mitigation strategies (e.g., re-sampling training data, post-processing adjustments to predictions, or model re-calibration techniques).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Key Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The following metrics will be crucial for quantifying bias and evaluating fairness: \n",
    "* **Fairness Metrics** Disparate Impact Ratio, Equalized Odds Difference, and other relevant fairness measures.\n",
    "* **Subgroup-Specific Performance** Accuracy, Precision, and Recall calculated independently for each demographic subgroup.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Rough Data Needs\n",
    "\n",
    "Anonymized patient health records are essential, containing: \n",
    "* **Demographic attributes:** Including sensitive information such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.\n",
    "*  **Hypothetical model's outputs:** This could be risk predictions, diagnostic classifications, or other relevant model outputs.\n",
    "* **Actual patient outcomes:** Ground truth data against which model outputs can be compared. "
